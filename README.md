   ```sh
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```sh
   # Copy the example file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   # See backend/.env.example for detailed instructions
   ```

3. **Environment variables needed:**
   ```
   # API Keys
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY=your_eleven_labs_api_key
   FETCH_AI_API_KEY=your_fetch_ai_api_key
   CORAL_API_KEY=your_coral_api_key  # For decentralized identity and verifiable credentials
   
   # Snowflake Database
   SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=your_snowflake_account
   SNOWFLAKE_USER=your_snowflake_user
   SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=your_snowflake_password
   SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE=your_snowflake_database
   SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA=your_snowflake_schema
   SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE=your_snowflake_warehouse
   SNOWFLAKE_ROLE=your_snowflake_role
   
   # JWT
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   
   # Application Configuration
   ENVIRONMENT=development  # Set to 'production' in production environment
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
   BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
   
   # Feature Flags
   SEED_SAMPLE_DATA=true  # Set to 'false' to disable sample data seeding
   ```

3. **Get your API keys:**
   - **Groq:** [Console](https://console.groq.com/) (for LLM & STT)
   - **ElevenLabs:** [Dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/) (for TTS)
   - **Fetch.ai:** [Console](https://console.fetch.ai/) (for public info)
   - **Snowflake:** [App](https://app.snowflake.com/) (database)
   - **Coral Protocol:** [Website](https://coralprotocol.com/) (activity logging)

4. **Test the database setup (optional but recommended):**
   ```sh
   cd backend
   python -m app.db.test_db_setup
   ```

5. **Run the backend:**
   ```sh
   cd backend
   python run.py
   ```
   
   Alternatively, you can use uvicorn directly:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

### 2. Frontend Setup

1. **Install Node.js dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the frontend:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## üîê Security Notes

- **Never commit `.env` files** - they contain sensitive API keys
- Use `.env.example` as a template for your own `.env` file
- Each collaborator should have their own API keys

## üìö API Documentation

Once the backend is running, visit:
- **Swagger UI:** http://localhost:8000/docs
- **ReDoc:** http://localhost:8000/redoc
